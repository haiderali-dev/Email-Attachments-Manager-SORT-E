# Search Attachments UI Changes

## Overview
Modified the "Search Results" section under "Search Attachments" to display only specific details for each attachment as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Table Structure Modification
**File**: `views/main/search_attachments_window.py`

**Before**: 7 columns
- 📎 Filename
- 📧 Subject  
- 👤 Sender
- 📅 Date
- 📏 Size
- 📋 Type
- 📧 Account

**After**: 5 columns
- 📎 File Name
- 📧 Subject
- 👤 Sender
- 📁 Path in Device
- 🏷️ Tag

### 2. Column Headers Updated
```python
# Modified in create_results_panel method
self.results_table.setColumnCount(5)
self.results_table.setHorizontalHeaderLabels([
    "📎 File Name", "📧 Subject", "👤 Sender", "📁 Path in Device", "🏷️ Tag"
])
```

### 3. Data Display Logic Updated
**File**: `views/main/search_attachments_window.py` - `display_results` method

#### New Column Logic:

**File Name**: 
- Shows the attachment filename
- Uses `result.get('filename', 'Unknown Attachment')`

**Subject**: 
- Shows the email subject
- Uses `result['subject'] or "No Subject"`

**Sender**: 
- Shows the email sender
- Uses `result['sender'] or "Unknown"`

**Path in Device**: 
- For downloaded attachments: Shows the folder name where the file is located
- For INBOX attachments: Shows "Not downloaded"
- Queries the `attachments` table for `file_path` when `attachment_id` exists
- Uses `os.path.dirname()` and `os.path.basename()` to extract folder name
- Shows "Root" for files in root directory

**Tag**: 
- Shows associated tags for the email
- Queries the `email_tags` and `tags` tables
- Shows "No tags" if no tags are assigned
- Uses `GROUP_CONCAT` to combine multiple tags with commas

### 4. Database Queries Added

#### Path in Device Query:
```sql
SELECT file_path FROM attachments WHERE id = %s
```

**Path Processing Logic:**
```python
directory_path = os.path.dirname(file_path)
folder_name = os.path.basename(directory_path)
if folder_name and folder_name != "":
    path_display = folder_name
else:
    path_display = "Root"
```

#### Tag Query:
```sql
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(t.name ORDER BY t.name SEPARATOR ', ') as tags
FROM email_tags et
LEFT JOIN tags t ON et.tag_id = t.id
WHERE et.email_id = %s
```

## Technical Implementation

### Error Handling
- Database connection errors are caught and display appropriate messages
- Missing data is handled gracefully with fallback values
- File path errors show "Error loading path"
- Tag loading errors show "Error loading tags"

### Performance Considerations
- Database queries are executed for each row in the results
- Connections are properly closed after each query
- Error handling prevents crashes from database issues

### UI Improvements
- Column widths are optimized for the new content
- File Name and Subject columns stretch to fill available space
- Path in Device column stretches to show longer paths
- Tag column resizes to content for better readability

## Benefits

1. **Focused Information**: Shows only the most relevant details
2. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of file info, email context, and metadata
3. **Improved Readability**: Reduced clutter with fewer columns
4. **Enhanced Functionality**: Folder information helps users understand file organization
5. **Tag Integration**: Shows associated tags for better categorization

## Testing

The changes have been tested to ensure:
- ✅ Table headers display correctly
- ✅ Database queries work properly
- ✅ Error handling functions as expected
- ✅ UI remains responsive and user-friendly
- ✅ All required information is displayed accurately

## Usage

Users can now:
1. Search for attachments using the search interface
2. View results in a cleaner, more focused table
3. See the folder name where downloaded attachments are stored
4. View associated tags for better organization
5. Access detailed information by double-clicking on results
