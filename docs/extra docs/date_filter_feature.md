# Date Filter Feature

## Overview
The Email Management System now includes a calendar-based date filter in the email list dropdown. This feature allows users to filter emails by selecting a specific date, showing only emails received on that date.

## How to Use

1. **Access the Date Filter**:
   - In the Email Management Dashboard, locate the filter dropdown in the Email List section
   - The dropdown is located next to the search box

2. **Select Date Filter**:
   - Click on the filter dropdown
   - Select "Date" from the available options
   - A date picker will appear next to the dropdown

3. **Choose a Date**:
   - Click on the date picker to open a calendar popup
   - Select your desired date
   - The email list will automatically filter to show only emails from that date

4. **Clear the Filter**:
   - Select "All" from the filter dropdown to show all emails again
   - The date picker will be hidden when not using the date filter

## Features

- **Calendar Popup**: Click the date picker to open a user-friendly calendar interface
- **Automatic Filtering**: Emails are filtered immediately when a date is selected
- **Visual Feedback**: The email count label shows how many emails were found for the selected date
- **Easy Reset**: Simply select "All" to clear the date filter

## Technical Implementation

- **Widget**: Uses PyQt5's `QDateEdit` widget with calendar popup enabled
- **Database Query**: Filters emails using `DATE(e.date) = selected_date` SQL condition
- **UI Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing filter system
- **Responsive Design**: Date picker shows/hides based on filter selection

## Example Usage

```
Filter Dropdown: [All â–¼] â†’ Select "Date"
Date Picker: [ðŸ“… 12/25/2024] â†’ Click to open calendar
Result: Shows only emails from December 25, 2024
Email Count: "5 emails from 2024-12-25"
```
